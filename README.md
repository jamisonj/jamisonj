### Hi there! My name is Justin Jamison! ðŸ‘‹
Are you seeking a Full-Stack Developer who embodies dedication, innovation, and an unwavering commitment to excellence? Look no further.

I'm a versatile Full-Stack Developer with a passion for solving complex technical challenges. With a robust skill set that spans across JavaScript, PHP, React, Node, Drupal, Docker, and AWS, I bring a wealth of expertise to the table. My experience is focused on content management, localization/translations, ecommerce and data migration, where I've consistently delivered impactful solutions that drive results.

I value user-centered design, simplicity, efficiency, security, privacy, and visual appeal. I strongly believe in best practices and well-designed processes - the journey is as important as the destination. As a lifelong learner, I stay at the forefront of industry trends and technologies.

Beyond technical proficiency, I am driven by a profound sense of ethics and a deep-seated desire to make a positive impact in the world. I am committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity in all that I do.

If you are seeking someone with these qualities, I am excited to join your team! Send me a LinkedIn message or email to get the conversation going.
